Problem 6
---------

 > The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

 > 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385

 > The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

 > (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025

 > Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural
 numbers and the square of the sum is `3025 - 385 = 2640`.

 > Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred
 natural numbers and the square of the sum.

There is alternative algebraic solution that relies on knowing that the sum of
the first `n` natural numbers is `n(n+1)/2` and that the sum of the first `n`
squares is `n(n+1)(2n+1)/6`. These are both easy to prove by induction, but I
wasn't able to derive them by myself.

Good thing it is a trivial algorithm to code.
