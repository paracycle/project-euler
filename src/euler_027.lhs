Problem 27
----------

 > Considering quadratics of the form:
 >
 > |nÂ² + an + b|, where both |a| and |b| are between -1000 and 1000.
 >
 > Find the product of the coefficients, |a| and |b|, for the quadratic

The `primes` generator from problem 7 is used. Note that negative numbers are
not considered prime.

> isPrime x
>   | x < 2     = False
>   | otherwise = coprime primes x

For the equation to be prime when |n = 0|, |b| must be prime. For |n > 0|, |a|
must be odd.  If it was even, then all odd values of |n| would give an even
result: |n * n| would be odd, |n * a| even, and |b| is odd, the sum of which is
even and cannot be prime. In this case, the maximum length of a chain could
only ever be one, which is not going to be the answer.
